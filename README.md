# Angular Essentials - Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code

This extension pack for Visual Studio Code adds extensions that are useful for Angular projects. I reserve the right to update the extensions pack contents up to my own discretion. This extension is for my personal use, I think it's great if it works for other people too.

## Reasons

The [Angular Essentials extension pack] was made to automate and standardize the installation phase of the essential Angular extensions for Visual Studio Code every time a new member joins the team, or one of them restores a laptop, or exchanges it for a new one.

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes
